        <p id="one">Hi there! My name's Natalie, and I am so glad you made it to my page! I'm originally from a
          place called Randolph, New Jersey, but I made my way out to Boulder, Colorado in 2018.</p>
        <p id="two">I came to this lovely land in order to get my degree at The University of Colorado Boulder! I'm currently
          on track to graduate in May of 2022 with a degree in marketing along with a minor in creative technology design.</p>
        <p id="three">If you took a look at the photos above, then you've seen some of the most important people in my life.
          I value my friends, family, & cat more than anything, and I am so lucky to have them!</p>
        <p id="four">I hope to eventually pursue a creative marketing career within the fashion/clothing industry. That would
          allow me to combine a few of my many passions while making a living - what more could a girl want?</p>
